# Decisions at the Crossroad

# Buggy Code:

number = (1 - 3)

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number == 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else: 
    print("The number is negative.")


# The Greatest Showdown

Number = 12

if Number <= 4:
    print("Got a low baller here")
elif Number <= 8:
    print("now we're talking")
elif Number >= 12:
    print("Well don't that beat all")
else:
    print("now your not paying attention to the rules")
